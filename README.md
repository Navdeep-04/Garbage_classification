# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model to automatically classify types of garbage (e.g., plastic, metal, organic, etc.) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 🚀 Features

- Trained on a real-world garbage classification dataset.
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model development.
- Performs image data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
- Includes model training and evaluation.
- Useful for waste management and smart recycling systems.
